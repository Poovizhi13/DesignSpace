3D Room & Furniture Designer (Web-based)”

Goal:
Create a web-based 3D interactive modeling tool where users can design and customize a room layout and add furniture models. The app should support both 2D (top-view blueprint) and 3D visualization, with measurement units in feet and interactive scaling and movement of furniture.

🏗️ Project Overview

Build a 3D room and furniture modeling web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (preferably with Three.js for 3D rendering).
The project should run in a browser and be compatible with Replit’s free hosting.

🎨 Core Features
1. Room Setup

User can define room width, length, and height in feet.

The room is rendered as a simple 3D box or rectangular prism with visible floor and walls.

Measurements update dynamically when user changes room size (using sliders or input boxes).

2. Furniture Management

Furniture models (e.g., chair.glb, table.glb, bed.glb, sofa.glb) are imported from a local /models/ folder.

Furniture items are categorized (e.g., Seating, Storage, Decor).

Developer can easily add new furniture by placing .glb or .obj models in the folder and adding entries to a JSON file (e.g., furnitureList.json).

3. Adding Furniture

User can choose a furniture category and select an item from a dropdown or menu.

When placed, furniture appears at a default position inside the room and can be:

Moved (dragged along X/Z plane)

Rotated

Scaled up or down

Deleted

4. Measurement System

All measurements (room dimensions, furniture size, distance from wall) are displayed in feet.

Include grid or floor markers in 1-foot increments for reference.

5. 2D/3D View Toggle

User can switch between:

3D Mode: Full perspective view of the room with furniture.

2D Mode: Top-down orthographic view (like a floor plan or blueprint).

Switching retains all furniture positions and scales.

6. Controls

Use OrbitControls for 3D camera movement (pan, zoom, rotate).

In 2D mode, lock camera to top view but allow zoom and pan.

Furniture can be selected by clicking and modified via side panel controls.

7. User Interface

Left/Top Panel: Input for room size (width, length, height)

Right Panel: Furniture categories and selection

Bottom Toolbar: Buttons for:

Add Object

Delete Object

Scale (+ / –)

Toggle 2D/3D view

Reset Scene

8. Save/Load (Optional for later)

Optionally allow users to save room layout to JSON and reload later.

⚙️ Technical Requirements

Frontend Only: No backend required for now.

Libraries:

three.js for 3D

OrbitControls for camera

GLTFLoader for loading furniture models

dat.GUI or custom sidebar for user input

Units: Use 1 foot = 0.3048 meters for scaling internally in Three.js.

Folder Structure:

/public
   index.html
   style.css
   script.js
   /models/
       chair.glb
       bed.glb
       table.glb
   furnitureList.json

🧩 Developer Notes

Furniture placement and scaling should be intuitive with click-and-drag.

Room floor grid should clearly show measurement divisions (1-foot grid lines).

Keep UI minimal and clean.

Code should be modular — e.g., separate functions for room generation, model loading, and UI updates.

Support resizing of browser window dynamically.

💡 Example User Flow

User opens app → prompted to set room width (e.g., 12 ft), length (e.g., 14 ft), height (e.g., 10 ft).

App renders the room.

User selects Furniture → Bed → Double Bed, places it, and drags to position.

User scales the bed slightly smaller.

Switches to 2D top view to adjust placement precisely.

Switches back to 3D to preview the arrangement.

Can remove or move items anytime.
